# Navigate files

Some useful hints for using the cd command:

To navigate to your home directory, use "cd" or "cd ~"
To navigate up one directory level, use "cd .."
To navigate to the previous directory (or back), use "cd -"
To navigate into the root directory, use "cd /"
To navigate through multiple levels of directory at once, 
     specify the full directory path that you want to go to. 
     For example, use "cd ~/OFGT-data/images" to go directly to the images subdirectory in the OFGT-data folder.
     As another example, "cd ~/Desktop" will move you to the Desktop subdirectory inside your home directory.
